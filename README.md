# Authly
For the Authly YSWS (also a fun hackclub project!)

## How does this work?

### Website
This system uses postgres for the database & currently it is deployed to vercel.


### Auth
The auth system is based on json matching, yes even which video is currently playing counts as well.

The json format looks something like this:
```json
{

}
```
